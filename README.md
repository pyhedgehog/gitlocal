# gitlocal
Support git local subcommand. Currently only in preliminary status - it works only on author computer due to absence of any documentation.
If you can and want to provide documentation PR will be accepted gratefully.

## todo
 - Rethink subcommands list.
 - Rethink config change logic (local-only is bad).
 - Maybe add and push all on init?
 - Write installation commands.
 - Write installation instructions.
